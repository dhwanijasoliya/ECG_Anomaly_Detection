# ECG_Anomaly_Detection

This project aims to detect anomalies in Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using machine learning techniques. The project uses data from the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**, which contains ECG signals annotated for various types of arrhythmias.

## Overview

ECG anomaly detection is critical in identifying potential health problems like arrhythmias, which can lead to serious conditions like heart attacks. This project demonstrates how to use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for detecting anomalies in ECG signals.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**, a well-known ECG dataset containing 48 half-hour long, two-channel ECG recordings. These recordings are annotated with various types of arrhythmias.
