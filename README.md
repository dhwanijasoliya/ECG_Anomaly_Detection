## ECG_Anomaly_Detection

This project detects anomalies in Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using machine learning techniques. In this project, data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database was used to develop the algorithm; the database contains ECG signals with various types of arrhythmias annotated.

ECG anomaly detection is very critical because it helps in the identification of several potential health problems such as arrhythmias, which are linked to serious conditions like heart attacks. CNN and LSTM is used for anomaly detection. 

## Dataset

The dataset utilized for the work is the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. It is a representative ECG dataset that comprises 48 half-an-hour-long, two-channel ECG recordings. These are annotated with a variety of types of arrhythmias.
